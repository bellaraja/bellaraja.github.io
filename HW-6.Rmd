#First, filter to San Francisco PUMAs. Provide a map showing these PUMAs. You’ll notice at least three strange geographic anomalies, which you should keep note of but ignore as they won’t affect this analysis.

```


Map of SF PUMAS
```{r}
mapview(sf_pumas)
```
#Then grab PUMS data for these PUMAs. Besides some standard fields you’ll need (per your understanding of the textbook examples), in order to represent the CES-related fields, make sure to get YBL, BLD, TEN, MV, HINCP, and AGEP. Refer to the official codebook to understand the coding of these fields. 

```{r}

pums_2019_1yr <- getCensus(
  name = "acs/acs1/pums",
  vintage = 2019,
  region = "public use microdata area:*", 
  regionin = "state:06",
  vars = c(
    "SERIALNO",
    "SPORDER",
    "PWGTP",
    "WGTP",
    "NP",
    "HHL",
    "HINCP",
    "TEN",
    "YBL", 
    "BLD",  
    "MV",
    "AGEP",
    "HUPAC"
  )
)
```
#Make YBL, ACEP, and HINCP numeric.
Filter YBL to the correct codes that are for buildings built before 1960.
There are many possible ways to identify households with at least one child less than 6 years old, but no matter what, you want to collapse the number of rows in your dataframe so that there’s only one row per SERIALNO. You should recognize this as something group_by() and summarize() are well-positioned to do. 

#You have used sum() and mean() inside of a summarize() before. Here, you could write a sum() inside of summarize() to count the number of people under a certain age, or min() inside of summarize() to find the youngest person within the household, or you could order your dataset by age, and use first() inside of summarize() to get a similar effect. For all other fields you’d want to retain (WGTP, YBL, BLD, TEN, MV, HINCP, PUMA) through this collapse process, the values don’t vary within the group, so the easiest technique is usually first() on each variable.  
Use mutate() to create a variable called leadrisk, which can be set to 1 when two conditions are both true (use & to link two conditional statements about HINCP and AGEP).


#Filter to housing structures built before 1960. This is a simplification of the more complicated breakdown shown in Table 2 of the Appendix of the Lead Risk Chapter in the CES report. 
#Keep in mind that fields you want to be numeric may be character class, so you need to convert using as.numeric().
```{r}
sf_pums <- pums_2019_1yr %>% 
  mutate(
    PUMA = str_pad(public_use_microdata_area,5, "left","0")
  )%>% 
  filter(PUMA %in%  sf_pumas$PUMACE10)


sf_pums_clean <- sf_pums %>%
  mutate(
    YBL = as.numeric(YBL),
    AGEP = as.numeric(AGEP)
  ) %>% 
  filter(YBL %in% 1:3)

```

```{r}
sf_pums_final <- sf_pums_clean %>% 
  group_by(SERIALNO) %>%
    arrange(AGEP) %>%
    summarize_all(first)

```


#Create a variable (leadrisk) which is 1 if household income is less than $90K and the household has at least one child less than 6 years old, and 0 if not. Note that $90K is a simplification of the 80% of County AMI criteria from CES.

```{r}
lead_risk_var <- 
  sf_pums_final %>% 
  mutate(
    WGTP = as.numeric(WGTP),
    lead_risk = ifelse(
      (HINCP < 90000) &
      (AGEP < 6),
      1,
      0
  ) 
  )
```
#In chapter 5.4, I provide an example of turning SCHL into a factor, which causes the lm() output to have different rows for education1, education2, etc. Similarly, you should mutate BLD, TEN, MV, and PUMA into factors, before creating the logit model (following the example later on in the chapter). 
#summary(logit_model) will be adequate to report out.
#To make a prediction, since your dataframe has factors, you need to supply factors as well, which can be a bit harder to write directly into the predict() function. So it’s easier to first just grab one random row from your full dataset, using sample_n() (look this function up to see the simple way to use it). Then just supply this one-row dataframe inside of predict().

```{r}
sf_pums_factor <- lead_risk_var %>% 
   mutate(across(c("BLD", "TEN", "PUMA", "MV"), factor))
     


```

The Random Logit Model Response  

```{r}
logit_model <- glm( lead_risk ~ BLD + MV + PUMA + TEN ,
                    family = quasibinomial(),
                    data = sf_pums_factor
)
summary(logit_model)

sample <- sample_n(sf_pums_factor, 1)
sample
predict(logit_model, sample, type = "response")

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
